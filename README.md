# Welcome to HealthHealthABC

This is the front-end repository for the internal project of ChatChatABC which is focused in developing a medical website project for the doctors and the general consumers.

## Project Structure

Within this GitHub Repository, we have made three different sub directories that would help us create three separate interface for each given roles that we accommodate. By following this kind of structure, we would be able to develop front-end project that only contains the necessary requirements/packages for each respective roles.

### Sub-directories

- [end-customer](./end-customer/): This is where the front-end of the patients will be found.
- [admin](./admin/): This is where the front-end of the admin will be found.
- [partner](./partner/): This is where the front-end of the partner will be found.
